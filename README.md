# Programming-for-Data-Analysis

## Description:
This project aims to investigate and illustrate some of the main characteristics included in the NumPy sub-package Random.
All code has been inserted in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Usage
To run this code, please use the Jupyter Notebook file under the name random.ipynb. 

Jupyter Notebook can be initiated through Anaconda Navigator and it will use your browser to deploy both texts an code, as it includes an interpreter.

All code included in this project is Python 3.6.4. Additional packages needed to run this code are NumPy, matplotlib and Pandas.

All this packages can be individually downloaded and installed as per instructions available in their documentation. However, dowloading an installing [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) will ensure full compatibility for Linux, Mac and Windows systems. 

## Resources used
